# 3813ICT Assignment Phase 1 - s5153091 - Muhammad Usama Siddiqui

## Introduction

This assignment was focused on building a web-based chat application. This program was built using Angular for the front-end and made use of Express.js for the server-side communications. The data is being stored in JSON files
for the time being, however, by the second phase of this assignment, the app data will be stored on a mongoDB database.

## Git Use

This app was built using the help of Git as a means for version control. Each time a new function was implemented on both the Angular application and the server-side functionality, a commit was made to highlight those changes.
Each commit was only made after determining that the function being committed is functional. Each time a commit was made, it was pushed onto this particular GitHub repo for online access. Node modules have been ignored for this git
to save on memory.
